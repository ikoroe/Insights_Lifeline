Solution to cc-example

The aim of the project is to solve in my own way the challange stated in the cc-example(see forked repo in my profile). Two questions are meant to be answered.
I Started by checking the best language that will be suited for the project. After careful deliberations, I chose Python
Using notepad and python 2.7.4, I was able to completly solve question one(1)  to give the correct output(words_tweeted.py in 'src folder' runs on 'tweets.txt' to produce ft1.tx). the program has also been tested on other text files. 

Solving question two has been a bit challanging. I am only able to get the words per line for now...I am running against time.
