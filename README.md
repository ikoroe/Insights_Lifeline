Solution to cc-example

The aim of the project is to solve in my own way the challange stated in the cc-example.

This challenge is to implement two features:

1.  Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
2.  Calculate the median number of unique words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in.

I Started by checking the best language that will be suited for the project. After careful deliberations, I chose Python
Using notepad and python 2.7.4, I was able to completly solve question one(1)  to give the correct output(words_tweeted.py in 'src folder' runs on 'tweets.txt' to produce ft1.tx). the program has also been tested on other text files and worked on large files.  maketrans was used. 

Solving question two has been a bit challanging. I am only able to get the words per line for now...I am running against time.
